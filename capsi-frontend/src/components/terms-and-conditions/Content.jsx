            PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE
            YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH capsi-com AND LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH
            YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM capsi-com.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          In the event of any controversy or claim arising out of or relating in
          any way to these Terms or the Service, you and capsi-com agree to consult
          and negotiate with each other and, recognizing your mutual interests,
          try to reach a solution satisfactory to both parties. If we do not
          reach settlement within a period of 60 days, then either of us may, by
          notice to the other, demand mediation under the mediation rules of the
          Indian Council of Arbitration (ICA) based in New Delhi, India. We both
          give up our right to litigate our disputes and may not proceed to
          arbitration without first trying mediation, but you and capsi-com are NOT
          required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks
          equitable and other relief from the alleged unlawful use of
          copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents.
          Except as otherwise required under applicable law, you and capsi-com
          intend and agree: (a) not to assert class action or representative
          action procedures and agree that they will not apply in any
          arbitration involving the other; (b) not to assert class action or
          representative action claims against the other in arbitration or
          otherwise; and (c) will only submit individual claims in arbitration
          and will not seek to represent the interests of any other person or
          entity.
        </p>

        <p>
          If settlement is not reached within 60 days after service of a written
          demand for mediation, any unresolved controversy or claim will be
          resolved by arbitration in accordance with the rules of the Indian
          Council of Arbitration (ICA) based in New Delhi, India. The language
          of all proceedings and filings will be English. The arbitrator will
          render a written opinion including findings of fact and law and the
          award and/or determination of the arbitrator will be binding on the
          parties, and their respective administrators and assigns, and will not
          be subject to appeal. Judgment may be entered upon the award of the
          arbitrator in any court of competent jurisdiction. The expenses of the
          arbitration will be shared equally by the parties unless the
          arbitration determines that the expenses will be otherwise assessed
          and the prevailing party may be awarded its attorneys’ fees and
          expenses by the arbitrator. It is the intent of the parties that,
          barring extraordinary circumstances, arbitration proceedings will be
          concluded within 90 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed.
          The arbitrator may extend this time limit only if failure to do so
          would unduly prejudice the rights of the parties. Failure to adhere to
          this time limit will not constitute a basis for challenging the award.
          Consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration, pre-hearing
          information exchange will be limited to the reasonable production of
          relevant, non-privileged documents, carried out expeditiously.
